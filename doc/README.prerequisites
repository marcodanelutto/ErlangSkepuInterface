in order to be able to run the Erlang SKEPU interface, you need: 
	
  - a complete Erlang/OTP installation (R15 or later)
  - a complete SKEPU installation (1.0 or later)
  - perl (5.8 or later)
  - gcc/g++ (4.8 or later)

by running a 
	make cpu 
you'll get a version working on the CPU cores through OpenMP

by running a 
	make gpu
you'll get a version working on the GPU through SKEPU
